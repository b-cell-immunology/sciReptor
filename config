# === Analysis Pipeline General Config File ===
#
# In general, this file contains <key>=<value> pairs that have to be compatible with bash. Therefore:
# - <key> has to be a valid BASH variable name, i.e. contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores, 
#   and must not begin with a number.
# - NO white space characters directly before or after the "=" of the <key>=<value> pair
# - Trailing semi-colons and white space characters will be removed from <value>
# - Lines starting with "#" will be considered comments
# - Environment variables and variables previously (!) defined in the config file will be expanded (SEE BELOW)
#
# However, this file is also parsed by other (non-bash) scripts, which results in the following limitations:
# - Usage of commands other than <key>=<value> pairs and comments IS NOT SUPPORTED
# - variable expansion requires variables to be written in "curly style" (e.g. ${HOME}). The "normal style" 
#   (e.g. $HOME) will not be expanded by the scripts, but might or might not by other programs, leading to
#   potentially unpredictable results.

# Search motives to define end of the CDR3 region.

# The following regular expressions are critical, there is no warning in case they are modified.
# They need to be compatible to Perl regexp, but the config is also used as bash source. Pipes ("|") need to
# be escaped ("\"). ATTENTION: The CDR3 motives are assumed to be four characters long. In case you do not
# want to use a given altCDR3 motif, replace it with a string that does not occur in nucleotide sequences,
# such as "ZZZZ". DO NOT remove or comment out the altCDR3 motif or pass an empty string, as this will
# lead to an unconditional match at position 0. Further note that the '.*' term at the begin of the CDR3
# regexp is greedy and will result in matching the LAST occurrence of the motif. Removing it will cause
# the expression to match the first occurrence.

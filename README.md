sciReptor - single cell immunoglobulin repertoire analysis toolkit
==================================================================

Installation
------------

Due to several external tools and various dependencies, sciReptor will take
around half an hour to be setup up. Step-by-step guides for the host and the
toolkit itself (including demo datasets) are available. However, in case you
want to have a look at it first, there is also a completely set up **virtual
machine [available][]** (as VirtualBox 4.3 appliance), which contains every-
thing including two pre-installed demo datasets.
